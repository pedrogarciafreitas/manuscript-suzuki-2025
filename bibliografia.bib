abstract = {The frequent use of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has led to the increased recognition of aortic atheromas. Retrospective and prospective follow-up studies have reported an association between aortic atheromas and stroke in the high-risk patient population, with complex plaques being more likely to embolize than simple plaques. However, TEE-based studies in the low-risk cohorts have failed to show a similar association. There is growing body of evidence suggesting that aortic atheroma is a marker of generalized atherosclerosis. Although magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) scan are emerging as a powerful noninvasive tool for characterization of aortic atheromas, TEE is the imaging modality of choice. Currently, treatment of aortic atheromas is not well defined, and mixed outcomes have been reported for anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Statins appear promising based on their plaque stabilization properties. However, there are no randomized control trials to establish the role of both anticoagulation and statins in patients with aortic atheromas, and are warranted in the future.},

    abstract = { Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a condition caused by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils in the heart. It is an underdiagnosed disease entity which can present with a variety of cardiac and non-cardiac manifestations. Diagnosis usually follows an initial suspicion based on clinical evaluation or imaging findings before confirmation with subsequent imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy) in combination with biochemical screening for monoclonal dyscrasia (serum free light chains and serum and urine electrophoresis) and/or histology (bone marrow trephine, fat or endomyocardial biopsy). More than 95\% of CA can be classified as either amyloid light-chain (AL) CA or amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) CA; these two conditions have very different management strategies. AL-CA, which may be associated with multiple myeloma, can be managed with chemotherapy agents, autologous stem cell transplantation, cardiac transplant and supportive therapies. For ATTR-CA, there is increasing importance in making an early diagnosis because of novel treatments in development, which have transformed this once incurable disease to a potentially treatable disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial as there may only be a small window of opportunity where patients can benefit from treatment beyond which therapies may be less effective. Reviewing the existing patient pathway provides a basis to better understand the complexities of real-world activities which may be important to help reduce missed opportunities related to diagnosis and treatment for patients with CA. With healthcare provider interest in improving the care of patients with CA, the development of an optimal care pathway for the condition may help reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment and thus enhance patient outcomes. }

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) remains the most immediately accessible and widely used diagnostic tool for guiding emergency treatment strategies. The ECG recorded during acute myocardial ischemia is of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic significance. In patients with myocardial ischemia as a result of decreased blood supply, the initial 12-lead ECG typically shows (1) predominant ST-segment elevation (STE) as part of STE acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS), or (2) no predominant STE, that is, non–STE ACS (NSTE-ACS). Patients with predominant STE are classified as having either aborted myocardial infarction (MI) or ST-elevation MI (STEMI) based on the absence or presence of biomarkers of myocardial necrosis. The MI may be aborted either by spontaneous or therapeutic reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium before development of myocardial cell necrosis. NSTE-ACS patients are classified as having either unstable angina or NSTE-MI, based also on the absence or presence of biomarkers of mycardial necrosis. The information obtained from the 12-lead ECG at presentation should be complemented by repeated ECGs especially during symptoms indicative of ischemia and, if applicable, by comparing the findings with reference ECGs. Also, continuous ECG recording in a coronary care setting, including the comparison of ECGs with and without pain, adds to the information gained at patient presentation. In this article, mechanisms of ischemic ECG changes and the ECG patterns recorded in both STE-ACS and NSTE-ACS are described. ECG patterns of NSTE-ACS, which include ST depression, negative T wave, and even normal ECG, need to be better defined in future studies to correlate them with the severity and extent of ischemia and to explore to what extent they are explained by acute active ischemia or represent consequences of ischemia. One of the aims of this article is to propose a classification of the ECG patterns encountered in different clinical scenarios of ACS. How these patterns will aid in guiding the diagnostic and therapeutic process is discussed.}

This article introduces Brno University of Technology Smartphone PPG Database (BUT PPG) which is an original database created by the cardiology team at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Brno University of Technology, for the purpose of evaluating photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal quality and estimation of heart rate (HR). The data comprises 48 10-second recordings of PPGs and associated electrocardiographic (ECG) signals used for determination of reference HR. The data were collected from 12 subjects (6 female, 6 male) aged between 21 and 61. PPG data were collected by smartphone Xiaomi Mi9 with sampling frequency of 30 Hz. Reference ECG signals were recorded using a mobile ECG recorder (Bittium Faros 360) with a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. Each PPG signal includes annotation of quality created manually by biomedical experts and reference HR. PPG signal quality is indicated binary: 1 indicates good quality for HR estimation, 0 indicates signals where HR cannot be detected reliably, and thus, these signals are unsuitable for further analysis. As the only available database containing PPG signals recorded by smartphone, BUT PPG is a unique tool for the development of smart, user-friendly, cheap, on-the-spot, self-home-monitoring of heart rate with the potential of widespread using.},

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise. }

We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

However, the direct metric, e.g., speed, also depends on the other factors such as memory access cost and platform characterics. Thus, this work proposes to evaluate the direct metric on the target platform, beyond only considering FLOPs. Based on a series of controlled experiments, this work derives several practical guidelines for efficient network design. Accordingly, a new architecture is presented, called ShuffleNet V2. Comprehensive ablation experiments verify that our model is the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy tradeoff.",

abstract="Transformers have recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-attention mechanisms with respect to image size has limited their wide adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and scalable attention model we call multi-axis attention, which consists of two aspects: blocked local and dilated global attention. These design choices allow global-local spatial interactions on arbitrary input resolutions with only linear complexity. We also present a new architectural element by effectively blending our proposed attention model with convolutions, and accordingly propose a simple hierarchical vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply repeating the basic building block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is able to ``see'' globally throughout the entire network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a broad spectrum of vision tasks. On image classification, MaxViT achieves state-of-the-art performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT attains 86.5{\%} ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training, our model achieves 88.7{\%} top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT as a backbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as well as visual aesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed model expresses strong generative modeling capability on ImageNet, demonstrating the superior potential of MaxViT blocks as a universal vision module.

abstract = {Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet achieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8× faster than MobileNetV2 with 0.5% higher accuracy and 2.3× faster than NASNet with 1.2% higher accuracy. Our MnasNet also achieves better mAP quality than MobileNets for COCO object detection. Code is at https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mnasnet.},

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.},

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing mental and mainly motor dysfunctions. The negative impact on the patient’s daily routine has moved the science in search of new techniques that can reduce its negative effects and also identify the disease in individuals. One of the main motor characteristics of PD is the hand tremor faced by patients, which turns out to be a crucial information to be used towards a computer-aided diagnosis. In this context, we make use of handwriting dynamics data acquired from individuals when submitted to some tasks that measure abilities related to writing skills. This work proposes the application of recurrence plots to map the signals onto the image domain, which are further used to feed a Convolutional Neural Network for learning proper information that can help the automatic identification of PD. The proposed approach was assessed in a public dataset under several scenarios that comprise different combinations of deep-based architectures, image resolutions, and training set sizes. Experimental results showed significant accuracy improvement compared to our previous work with an average accuracy of over 87%. Moreover, it was observed an improvement in accuracy concerning the classification of patients (i.e., mean recognition rates above to 90%). The promising results showed the potential of the proposed approach towards the automatic identification of Parkinson’s disease.}

abstract = {This work proposes deep learning (DL) based epileptic seizure detection by generating 2D recurrence plot (RP) images of EEG signals for specific brain rhythms. The DL bypasses hand-crafted feature engineering, but extracts feature automatically from input images has displayed significant performance in various domain classification tasks. However, generating 2D images from 1D EEG signals and its quality assessment for DL pipeline has not been addressed properly, which is very crucial as the performance of the DL highly relies on input quality. Besides, suitable brain rhythm for seizure analysis has not been explored properly. Therefore, in this work, 2D input images have been generated by the RP technique from EEG signals for specific brain rhythms by preserving the nonlinear characteristics of EEG and employed a well-known DL, called convolution neural network (CNN). For, experimental validation, two well recognized EEG databases for seizure analysis from Bonn University and CHB-MIT (PhysioNet) have been considered. Eventually, three major parameters — recurrence threshold, time delay, and embedding dimension for an RP image generation have been evaluated and detailed. The results show that the proposed method can achieve classification accuracy up to 93%, which is significantly higher and the δ rhythm has been found suitable for seizure detection. The entropy of RP has been found as a suitable parameter for image quality assessment along with two global statistical parameters such as skewness of root mean square and standard of RP images. In performance evaluation, the proposed method demonstrates its competency by displaying the best classification accuracy compared to related works.}

ABSTRACT={<p>Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment that occurs in old. Early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease is great significance. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be used to detect Alzheimer's disease due to its non-invasive advantage. To solve the problem of insufficient analysis by single-channel EEG signal, we analyze the relationship between multiple channels and build PLV framework. To solve the problem of insufficient representation of 1D signal, a threshold-free recursive plot convolution network was constructed to realize 2D representation. To solve the problem of insufficient EEG signal characterization, a fusion algorithm of clinical features and imaging features was proposed to detect Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that the algorithm has good performance and robustness.</p>}}

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases affect approximately 50 million people worldwide; thus, heart disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system. Despite the high popularity electrocardiography, superior automatic electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis methods are required. The aim of this research was to design a new deep learning method for effectively classifying arrhythmia by using 2-second segments of 2D recurrence plot images of ECG signals. In the first stage, the noise and ventricular fibrillation (VF) categories were distinguished. In the second stage, the atrial fibrillation (AF), normal, premature AF, and premature VF categories were distinguished. Models were trained and tested using ECG databases publicly available at the website of PhysioNet. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database, MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database, and MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Ectopy Database were used to compare six types of arrhythmia. Testing accuracies of up to 95.3 % ± 1.27 % and 98.41 % ± 0.11 % were achieved for arrhythmia detection in the first and second stage, respectively, after five-fold cross-validation. In conclusion, this study provides clinicians with an advanced methodology for detecting and discriminating between different arrhythmia types.}

    abstract = {Studying the interaction between a system's components and the temporal evolution of the system are two common ways to uncover and characterize its internal workings. Recently, several maps from a time series to a network have been proposed with the intent of using network metrics to characterize time series. Although these maps demonstrate that different time series result in networks with distinct topological properties, it remains unclear how these topological properties relate to the original time series. Here, we propose a map from a time series to a network with an approximate inverse operation, making it possible to use network statistics to characterize time series and time series statistics to characterize networks. As a proof of concept, we generate an ensemble of time series ranging from periodic to random and confirm that application of the proposed map retains much of the information encoded in the original time series (or networks) after application of the map (or its inverse). Our results suggest that network analysis can be used to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series and, perhaps more importantly, time series analysis can provide a powerful set of tools that augment the traditional network analysis toolkit to quantify networks in new and useful ways.},

abstract = {Physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often severely corrupted by noise, artifact and missing data, which lead to large errors in the estimation of the heart rate (HR) and ABP. A robust HR estimation method is described that compensates for these problems. The method is based upon the concept of fusing multiple signal quality indices (SQIs) and HR estimates derived from multiple electrocardiogram (ECG) leads and an invasive ABP waveform recorded from ICU patients. Physiological SQIs were obtained by analyzing the statistical characteristics of each waveform and their relationships to each other. HR estimates from the ECG and ABP are tracked with separate Kalman filters, using a modified update sequence based upon the individual SQIs. Data fusion of each HR estimate was then performed by weighting each estimate by the Kalman filters' SQI-modified innovations. This method was evaluated on over 6000 h of simultaneously acquired ECG and ABP from a 437 patient subset of ICU data by adding real ECG and realistic artificial ABP noise. The method provides an accurate HR estimate even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during episodes of extreme bradycardia and tachycardia.}

Its descriptive parameters are entirely based on time, but they can be derived also from the statistical moments of the power spectrum.

Further, the parameters are based on the concept of variance, giving them an additive property so that the measured values pertain also to any basic elements from which a complex curve may be composed by superposition.

L'auteur introduit une méthode de description des caractéristiques générales d'un tracé EEG en un nombre limité de termes quantitatifs. Ses paramètres descriptifs sont entièrement basés sur le temps, mais peuvent être dérivés également des moments statistiques du spectre de puissance. Ainsi, cette méthode fait la jonction entre une interprétation du domaine des séries temporelles physiques et la description du domaine fréquentiel conventionnel. De plus les paramètres sont basés sur le concept de variance, leur donnant une propriété supplémentaire de telle sorte que les valeurs mesurées se rapportent également à chaque élément de base à partir duquel une courbe complexe peut être composée par superposition. La méthode proposée offre un moyen de mesurer “on-line” des propriétés de base du signal au moyen d'un calcul basé sur le temps, nécessitant un équipement moins complexe que l'analyse de fréquence conventionnelle. La capacité de réduction des données des paramètries a été spécifiée expérimentalement dans l'enregistrement des “profils de sommeil”.}

abstract = {Background and Objectives
The presence of noise sources could reduce the diagnostic capability of the ECG signal and result in inappropriate treatment decisions. To mitigate this problem, automated algorithms to detect artefacts and quantify the quality of the recorded signal are needed. In this study we present an automated method for the detection of artefacts and quantification of the signal quality. The suggested methodology extracts descriptive features from the autocorrelation function and feeds these to a RUSBoost classifier. The posterior probability of the clean class is used to create a continuous signal quality assessment index. Firstly, the robustness of the proposed algorithm is investigated and secondly, the novel signal quality assessment index is evaluated.
Methods
Data were used from three different studies: a Sleep study, the PhysioNet 2017 Challenge and a Stress study. Binary labels, clean or contaminated, were available from different annotators with experience in ECG analysis. Two types of realistic ECG noise from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB) were added to the Sleep study to test the quality index. Firstly, the model was trained on the Sleep dataset and subsequently tested on a subset of the other two datasets. Secondly, all recording conditions were taken into account by training the model on a subset derived from the three datasets. Lastly, the posterior probabilities of the model for the different levels of agreement between the annotators were compared.
Results
AUC values between 0.988 and 1.000 were obtained when training the model on the Sleep dataset. These results were further improved when training on the three datasets and thus taking all recording conditions into account. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8131 was observed between the score of the clean class and the level of agreement. Additionally, significant quality decreases per noise level for both types of added noise were observed.
Conclusions
The main novelty of this study is the new approach to ECG signal quality assessment based on the posterior clean class probability of the classifier.}

abstract = {Current wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) recording systems have great potential to revolutionize early diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). They are able to continuously acquire an ECG signal for long weeks and then increase the probability of detecting first brief, intermittent signs of the arrhythmia. However, the recorded signal is often broadly corrupted by noise and artifacts, and accurate assessment of its quality to avoid automated misdiagnosis and false alarms of AF is still an unsolved challenge. In this context, the present work is pioneer in exploring the usefulness of transforming the single-lead ECG signal into two common phase space (PS) representations, such as the Poincaré plot and the first order difference graph, for evaluation of its quality. Several machine and deep learning models fed with features and images derived from these PS portraits reported a better performance than well-known previous methods, even when they were trained and validated on two separate databases. Indeed, in binary classification of high- and low-quality ECG excerpts, the generated PS-based algorithms reported a discriminant power greater than 85%, misclassifying less than 20% of high-quality AF episodes and non-normal rhythms as noisy excerpts. Moreover, because both PS reconstructions do not require any mathematical transformation, these algorithms also spent much less time in classifying each ECG excerpt in validation and testing stages than previous methods. As a consequence, ECG transformation to both PS portraits enables novel, simple, effective, and computational low-cost techniques, based both on machine and deep learning classifiers, for ECG quality assessment.}

abstract = {Healthcare is expected to increasingly shift care out of inpatient settings thanks to wearable monitoring systems. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique already integrated into wrist-worn commercial products which presents significant advantages in terms of cost and dimensions. PPG-based devices, despite their ability to detect multiple cardiovascular parameters, are affected by several influencing conditions that depend both on technological or environmental variables, and on intra- and inter-subject variability that influences the whole measurement chain and reliability, hindering an objective characterization of PPG devices. Plus, the lack of standardization for data collection and processing leads to the lack of generalizability and reproducibility of results, preventing the full exploitation of the potential prognostic capacity of this technology. Thus, this review aims not only to summarize the main influencing parameters of PPG technology, which should be addressed when testing the sensor, but also to suggest tentative guidelines for a possible future standardization initiative.}

abstract = {In this work, we describe a beat-by-beat method for assessing the clinical utility of pulsatile waveforms, primarily recorded from cardiovascular blood volume or pressure changes, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Physiological blood flow is nonstationary, with pulses changing in height, width and morphology due to changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sensor type and hardware or software pre-processing requirements. Moreover, considerable inter-individual and sensor-location variability exists. Simple template matching methods are therefore inappropriate, and a patient-specific adaptive initialization is therefore required. We introduce dynamic time warping to stretch each beat to match a running template and combine it with several other features related to signal quality, including correlation and the percentage of the beat that appeared to be clipped. The features were then presented to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to learn the relationships between the parameters in the presence of good- and bad-quality pulses. An expert-labeled database of 1055 segments of PPG, each 6 s long, recorded from 104 separate critical care admissions during both normal and verified arrhythmic events, was used to train and test our algorithms. An accuracy of 97.5% on the training set and 95.2% on test set was found. The algorithm could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the clinical utility of PPG traces or any similar quasi-periodic signal.}

			ABSTRACT = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to measure blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. Information about these changes along time can be used for estimation of various physiological parameters, such as heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure, to name a few. As a result, PPG has become a popular biological modality and is widely used in wearable health devices. However, accurate measurement of various physiological parameters requires good-quality PPG signals. Therefore, various signal quality indexes (SQIs) for PPG signals have been proposed. These metrics have usually been based on statistical, frequency, and/or template analyses. The modulation spectrogram representation, however, captures the second-order periodicities of a signal and has been shown to provide useful quality cues for electrocardiograms and speech signals. In this work, we propose a new PPG quality metric based on properties of the modulation spectrum. The proposed metric is tested using data collected from subjects while they performed various activity tasks contaminating the PPG signals. Experiments on this multi-wavelength PPG dataset show the combination of proposed and benchmark measures significantly outperforming several benchmark SQIs with improvements of 21.3% BACC (balanced accuracy) for green, 21.6% BACC for red, and 19.0% BACC for infrared wavelengths, respectively, for PPG quality detection tasks. The proposed metrics also generalize for cross-wavelength PPG quality detection tasks.},

			abstract = {Real-time remote health monitoring is dramatically growing, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and outcome in everyday settings. Such remote services enable monitoring individuals anywhere and anytime, allowing diseases early detection and prevention. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive and convenient technique that enables tracking vital signs such as heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and blood oxygen saturation. PPG is broadly used in various clinical and commercial wearable devices, as it is easy-to-implement and low-cost. However, the technique is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noises, which distort the collected signals. Therefore, the signal quality needs to be investigated, and unreliable signals should be discarded. In the literature, rule-based and machine learning-based PPG quality assessment methods have been investigated in several studies. However, the rule-based methods are mostly inaccurate in remote health monitoring, where users engage in different physical activities. The supervised machine learning-based methods –including deep learning–are also infeasible for real-time monitoring applications since they are slow and are dependent on a massive pool of annotated data to train the model. In this paper, we introduce a PPG quality assessment method, enabled by an elliptical envelope, which requires low computational resources. The method clusters the PPG signals into two groups as “reliable” and “unreliable.” We also investigate various features extracted from the PPG signals. Five features with the highest scoring values are selected to be fed to the elliptical envelope model. Moreover, we assess the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and execution time, using data collected in free-living conditions via an Internet-of-Things-based health monitoring system enabled by smart wristbands. The method is evaluated in comparison to a state-of-the-art PPG quality assessment method. We also provide the model implemented in Python for the community to be used in their solutions.}

The method is, however, highly susceptible to motion artifacts, which are inevitable in remote health monitoring. Noise reduces signal quality, leading to inaccurate decision-making. In addition, unreliable data collection and transmission waste a massive amount of energy on battery-powered devices. Studies in the literature have proposed PPG signal quality assessment (SQA) enabled by rule-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods. However, rule-based techniques were designed according to certain specifications, resulting in lower accuracy with unseen noise and artifacts. ML methods have mainly been developed to ensure high accuracy without considering execution time and device’s energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and energy-efficient PPG SQA method enabled by a semi-supervised learning strategy for edge devices. We first extract a wide range of features from PPG and then select the best features in terms of accuracy and latency. Second, we train a one-class support vector machine model to classify PPG signals into “Reliable” and “Unreliable” classes. We evaluate the proposed method in terms of accuracy, execution time, and energy consumption on two embedded devices, in comparison to five state-of-the-art PPG SQA methods. The methods are assessed using a PPG dataset collected via smartwatches from 46 individuals in free-living conditions. The proposed method outperforms the other methods by achieving an accuracy of 0.97 and a false positive rate of 0.01. It also provides the lowest latency and energy consumption compared to other ML-based methods.}

		abstract = {Objective: Photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring has been implemented in many portable and wearable devices we use daily for health and fitness tracking. Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical applications, such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias, fitness, and sleep tracking, and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts, which can lead to false interpretations. In many implementations, noisy PPG signals are discarded. Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)—a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. Approach: The training data set was composed of 78 278 30 s long PPG recordings from 3764 patients using bedside patient monitors. Two different representations of PPG signals were employed—a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D) one. Trained models were tested on an independent set of 2683 30 s PPG signals from 13 stroke patients. Main results: ResNet18 showed a higher performance (0.985 accuracy, 0.979 specificity, and 0.988 sensitivity) than SVM and other deep learning approaches. 2D-based models were generally more accurate than 1D-based models. Significance: 2D representation of PPG signal enhances the accuracy of PPG signal quality assessment.}

As PPG monitoring is relatively simple, non-invasive, and convenient, it is widely used in a variety of wearable devices (e.g., smart bands, smart rings, smartphones) to acquire different vital signs such as heart rate and pulse rate variability. However, the accuracy of such vital signs highly depends on the quality of the signal and the presence of artifacts generated by other resources such as motion. This unreliable performance is unacceptable in health monitoring systems. To tackle this issue, different studies have proposed motion artifacts reduction and signal quality assessment methods. However, they merely focus on improvements in the results and signal quality. Therefore, they are unable to alleviate erroneous decision making due to invalid vital signs extracted from the unreliable PPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel PPG quality assessment approach for IoT-based health monitoring systems, by which the reliability of the vital signs extracted from PPG quality is determined. Therefore, unreliable data can be discarded to prevent inaccurate decision making and false alarms. Exploiting a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach, a hypothesis function is created by comparing heart rate in the PPG with corresponding heart rate values extracted from ECG signal. We implement a proof-of-concept IoT-based system to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach.}

Some crucial vital signs, such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) etc. can be achieved from BVP for clinical medicine and healthcare application. As compared to the conventional PPG methods, rPPG is more promising because of its non-contacted measurement. However, both BVP detection methods, especially rPPG, are susceptible to motion and illumination artifacts, which lead to inaccurate estimation of vital signs. Signal quality assessment (SQA) is a method to measure the quality of BVP signals and ensure the credibility of estimated physiological parameters. But the existing SQA methods are not suitable for real-time processing. In this paper, we proposedalanzoka an end-to-end BVP signal quality evaluation method based on a long short-term memory network (LSTM-SQA). Two LSTM-SQA models were trained using the BVP signals obtained with PPG and rPPG techniques so that the quality of BVP signals derived from these two methods can be evaluated, respectively. As there is no publicly available rPPG dataset with quality annotations, we designed a training sample generation method with blind source separation, by which two kinds of training datasets respective to PPG and rPPG were built. Each dataset consists of 38400 high and low-quality BVP segments. The achieved models were verified on three public datasets (IIP-HCI dataset, UBFC-Phys dataset, and LGI-PPGI dataset). The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM-SQA models can effectively predict the quality of the BVP signal in real-time.},

		abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical method to acquire various vital signs, including heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). The PPG method is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. Unfortunately, such artifacts are inevitable in ubiquitous health monitoring, as the users are involved in various activities in their daily routines. Such low-quality PPG signals negatively impact the accuracy of the extracted health parameters, leading to inaccurate decision-making. PPG-based health monitoring necessitates a quality assessment approach to determine the signal quality according to the accuracy of the health parameters. Different studies have thus far introduced PPG signal quality assessment methods, exploiting various indicators and machine learning algorithms. These methods differentiate reliable and unreliable signals, considering morphological features of the PPG signal and focusing on the cardiac cycles. Therefore, they can be utilized for HR detection applications. However, they do not apply to HRV, as only having an acceptable shape is insufficient, and other signal factors may also affect the accuracy. In this article, we propose a deep learning–based PPG quality assessment method for HR and various HRV parameters. We employ one customized one-dimensional (1D) and three 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train models for each parameter. Reliability of each of these parameters will be evaluated against the corresponding electrocardiogram signal, using 210 hours of data collected from a home-based health monitoring application. Our results show that the proposed 1D CNN method outperforms the other 2D CNN approaches. Our 1D CNN model obtains the accuracy of 95.63\%, 96.71\%, 91.42\%, 94.01\%, and 94.81\% for the HR, average of normal to normal interbeat (NN) intervals, root mean square of successive NN interval differences, standard deviation of NN intervals, and ratio of absolute power in low frequency to absolute power in high frequency ratios, respectively. Moreover, we compare the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the-art algorithms. We compare our best models for HR-HRV health parameters with six different state-of-the-art PPG signal quality assessment methods. Our results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the other methods. We also provide the open source model implemented in Python for the community to be integrated into their solutions.},

	ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately evaluate the quality of a photoplethysmogram based on the shape of the photoplethysmogram and the phase relevance in a pulsatile waveform without requiring complicated pre-processing. Photoplethysmograms were recorded for 76 participants (5 min for each participant). All recorded photoplethysmograms were segmented for each beat to obtain a total of 49,561 pulsatile segments. These pulsatile segments were manually labeled as ‘good’ and ‘poor’ classes and converted to a two-dimensional phase space trajectory image using a recurrence plot. The classification model was implemented using a convolutional neural network with a two-layer structure. As a result, the proposed model correctly classified 48,827 segments out of 49,561 segments and misclassified 734 segments, showing a balanced accuracy of 0.975. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of the developed model for the test dataset with a ‘poor’ class classification were 0.964, 0.987, and 0.848, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.994. The convolutional neural network model with recurrence plot as input proposed in this study can be used for signal quality assessment as a generalized model with high accuracy through data expansion. It has an advantage in that it does not require complicated pre-processing or a feature detection process.},

abstract = {The Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE) is a heterogeneous meta ensemble for time series classification. HIVE-COTE forms its ensemble from classifiers of multiple domains, including phase-independent shapelets, bag-of-words based dictionaries and phase-dependent intervals. Since it was first proposed in 2016, the algorithm has remained state of the art for accuracy on the UCR time series classification archive. Over time it has been incrementally updated, culminating in its current state, HIVE-COTE 1.0. During this time a number of algorithms have been proposed which match the accuracy of HIVE-COTE. We propose comprehensive changes to the HIVE-COTE algorithm which significantly improve its accuracy and usability, presenting this upgrade as HIVE-COTE 2.0. We introduce two novel classifiers, the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble and Diverse Representation Canonical Interval Forest, which replace existing ensemble members. Additionally, we introduce the Arsenal, an ensemble of ROCKET classifiers as a new HIVE-COTE 2.0 constituent. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE 2.0 is significantly more accurate on average than the current state of the art on 112 univariate UCR archive datasets and 26 multivariate UEA archive datasets.},

TSF employs a combination of entropy gain and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance) gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance gain improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at each tree node and has computational complexity linear in the length of time series, and can be built using parallel computing techniques. The temporal importance curve is proposed to capture the temporal characteristics useful for classification. Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean, standard deviation and slope is computationally efficient and outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor classifiers with dynamic time warping.}

The ensemble based Bag of Symbolic Fourier Approximation Symbols (BOSS) was found to be a top performing TSC algorithm in a recent evaluation, as well as the best performing dictionary based classifier. However, BOSS does not scale well. We evaluate changes to the way BOSS chooses classifiers for its ensemble, replacing its parameter search with random selection. This change allows for the easy implementation of contracting (setting a build time limit for the classifier) and check-pointing (saving progress during the classifiers build). We achieve a significant reduction in build time without a significant change in accuracy on average when compared to BOSS by creating a fixed size weighted ensemble selecting the best performers from a randomly chosen parameter set. Our experiments are conducted on datasets from the recently expanded UCR time series archive. We demonstrate the usability improvements to randomised BOSS with a case study using a large whale acoustics dataset for which BOSS proved infeasible.",

abstract = {This paper brings deep learning at the forefront of research into time series classification (TSC). TSC is the area of machine learning tasked with the categorization (or labelling) of time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE cannot be applied to many real-world datasets because of its high training time complexity in O(N2·T4) for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 8 days to learn from a small dataset with N=1500 time series of short length T=46. Meanwhile deep learning has received enormous attention because of its high accuracy and scalability. Recent approaches to deep learning for TSC have been scalable, but less accurate than HIVE-COTE. We introduce InceptionTime—an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime is on par with HIVE-COTE in terms of accuracy while being much more scalable: not only can it learn from 1500 time series in one hour but it can also learn from 8M time series in 13 h, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

abstract = {Using bag of words representations of time series is a popular approach to time series classification (TSC). These algorithms involve approximating and discretising windows over a series to form words, then forming a count of words over a given dictionary. Classifiers are constructed on the resulting histograms of word counts. A 2017 evaluation of a range of time series classifiers found the bag of symbolic-Fourier approximation symbols (BOSS) ensemble the best of the dictionary based classifiers. It forms one of the components of hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based ensembles (HIVE-COTE), which represents the current state of the art. Since then, several new dictionary based algorithms have been proposed that are more accurate or more scalable (or both) than BOSS. We propose a further extension of these dictionary based classifiers that combines the best elements of the others combined with a novel approach to constructing ensemble members based on an adaptive Gaussian process model of the parameter space. We demonstrate that the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE) is more accurate than other dictionary based approaches. Furthermore, unlike the other classifiers, if we replace BOSS in HIVE-COTE with TDE, HIVE-COTE becomes significantly more accurate. We also show this new version of HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than the current top performing classifiers on the UCR time series archive. This advance represents a new state of the art for time series classification.},

abstract = {Time series (TS) occur in many scientific and commercial applications, ranging from earth surveillance to industry automation to the smart grids. An important type of TS analysis is classification, which can, for instance, improve energy load forecasting in smart grids by detecting the types of electronic devices based on their energy consumption profiles recorded by automatic sensors. Such sensor-driven applications are very often characterized by (a) very long TS and (b) very large TS datasets needing classification. However, current methods to time series classification (TSC) cannot cope with such data volumes at acceptable accuracy; they are either scalable but offer only inferior classification quality, or they achieve state-of-the-art classification quality but cannot scale to large data volumes. In this paper, we present WEASEL (Word ExtrAction for time SEries cLassification), a novel TSC method which is both fast and accurate. Like other state-of-the-art TSC methods, WEASEL transforms time series into feature vectors, using a sliding-window approach, which are then analyzed through a machine learning classifier. The novelty of WEASEL lies in its specific method for deriving features, resulting in a much smaller yet much more discriminative feature set. On the popular UCR benchmark of 85 TS datasets, WEASEL is more accurate than the best current non-ensemble algorithms at orders-of-magnitude lower classification and training times, and it is almost as accurate as ensemble classifiers, whose computational complexity makes them inapplicable even for mid-size datasets. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL is also confirmed by experiments on two real smart grid datasets, where it out-of-the-box achieves almost the same accuracy as highly tuned, domain-specific methods.},

abstract = {Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is an algorithm to align temporal sequences with possible local non-linear distortions, and has been widely applied to audio, video and graphics data alignments. DTW is essentially a point-to-point matching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints. Although DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve locally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely dissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we propose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping (shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural information into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but additionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching points with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio signal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated pairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment errors than DTW and its two variants. When shapeDTW is used as a distance measure in a nearest neighbor classifier (NN-shapeDTW) to classify time series, it beats DTW on 64 out of 84 UCR time series datasets, with significantly improved classification accuracies. By using a properly designed local structure descriptor, shapeDTW improves accuracies by more than 10% on 18 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, shapeDTW is the first distance measure under the nearest neighbor classifier scheme to significantly outperform DTW, which had been widely recognized as the best distance measure to date. Our code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/jiapingz/shapeDTW.}

abstract = {Time series feature engineering is a time-consuming process because scientists and engineers have to consider the multifarious algorithms of signal processing and time series analysis for identifying and extracting meaningful features from time series. The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications.}

abstract = {A recent experimental evaluation assessed 19 time series classification (TSC) algorithms and found that one was significantly more accurate than all others: the Flat Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (Flat-COTE). Flat-COTE is an ensemble that combines 35 classifiers over four data representations. However, while comprehensive, the evaluation did not consider deep learning approaches. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have seen a surge in popularity and are now state of the art in many fields and raises the question of whether CNNs could be equally transformative for TSC.We implement a benchmark CNN for TSC using a common structure and use results from a TSC-specific CNN from the literature. We compare both to Flat-COTE and find that the collective is significantly more accurate than both CNNs. These results are impressive, but Flat-COTE is not without deficiencies. We significantly improve the collective by proposing a new hierarchical structure with probabilistic voting, defining and including two novel ensemble classifiers built in existing feature spaces, and adding further modules to represent two additional transformation domains. The resulting classifier, the Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE), encapsulates classifiers built on five data representations. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than Flat-COTE (and all other TSC algorithms that we are aware of) over 100 resamples of 85 TSC problems and is the new state of the art for TSC. Further analysis is included through the introduction and evaluation of 3 new case studies and extensive experimentation on 1,000 simulated datasets of 5 different types.},

abstract = {A tree-ensemble method, referred to as time series forest (TSF), is proposed for time series classification. TSF employs a combination of entropy gain and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance) gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance gain improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at each tree node and has computational complexity linear in the length of time series, and can be built using parallel computing techniques. The temporal importance curve is proposed to capture the temporal characteristics useful for classification. Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean, standard deviation and slope is computationally efficient and outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor classifiers with dynamic time warping.}

abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an extensively researched field from which a broad range of real-world problems can be addressed obtaining excellent results. One sort of the approaches performing well are the so-called dictionary-based techniques. The Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE) is the current state-of-the-art dictionary-based TSC approach. In many TSC problems we find a natural ordering in the labels associated with the time series. This characteristic is referred to as ordinality, and can be exploited to improve the methods performance. The area dealing with ordinal time series is the Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) field, which is yet unexplored. In this work, we present an ordinal adaptation of the TDE algorithm, known as ordinal TDE (O-TDE). For this, a comprehensive comparison using a set of 18 TSOC problems is performed. Experiments conducted show the improvement achieved by the ordinal dictionary-based approach in comparison to four other existing nominal dictionary-based techniques.},
